# Welcome to Averi Wylie's GitHub Portfolio! 

This is a free source for other programmers, and people, to view my progress (from the software engineering side of things) as a computer scientist. Every game was made in part or entirely by me. Any project created in affilitiation with another programmer will say so.

Feel free to explore, and leave comments/tips in areas you think need imporvement, so don't hesitate to reach out for collaboratory opportunities.
